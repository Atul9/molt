*   Still pondering how to add context to client-defined commands.
    *   So that the command can make direct changes to the user's data.
*   At present, Interp is defined as Interp<T>, and a mutable T is passed
    to each command when it executes.  But it means that all commands
    get the same T.  This might be fine for a game, where there's a single
    context, but it's not general.
*   It might be possible to give each command its own context struct, which
    is *owned* by the Interp and can be modified by the command; and then
    queried by the owner of the Interp.

*   Created the project.
*   The first step is to parse a script into commands, and parse the commands
    into words, according to the Dodekalogue.
*   I will need an Interp to handle this.
*   Added an Interp struct with new(), define(), eval() methods, although eval()
    doesn't do anythingy yet.
*   Added gcl_check_args() function.  Perhaps should be method.
    *   Not clear whether I want the Interp API to be methods or functions.
*   Realized that I needed a Context type, so that client-created extensions
    can access their context.  But I'm not at all sure how to do this
    generally; it's much trickier than in C.
