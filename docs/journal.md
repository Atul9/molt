### 2019-01-20 (Sunday)
*   Found a write-up on proper Tcl list syntax in the Tcl code base,
    courtesy of wiki.tcl-lang.org.  See docs/list_format.txt.
    *   Two challenges: parsing lists into vectors, and formatting vectors
        as valid lists.
    *   Parsing lists into vectors:
        *   This is almost but not quite the same as parsing a command
            without evaluation (as you'd do for `info complete`).
        *   List of differences:
            *   The set of whitespace characters for lists consists
                of " ", \t, \n, \v, \f, \r.
            *   It includes \n which is a command terminator
            *   It does *not* include other unicode whitespace characters.
                *   It appears that these ARE valid whitespace during
                    command parsing.
            *   backslash-newline is NOT a whitespace character
        *   Backslash processing is done as for command parsing.
        *   TODO: When a backslash is the final character in a string,
            it is replaced by itself. (!)
            *   Should be true for command parsing as well.
        *   Braced-words are parsed as for commands, EXCEPT THAT
            backslash-newline is passed along unchanged rather than
            being converted to a space.
        *   Quoted words are processed without looking for interpolated
            variables or commands; in particular, single "[" characters
            are not an error.  The words ends with the first unescaped
            double-quote.  THEN, backslash substitution is done on the
            word AFTER the full word is known.
        *   Bare words are processed without looking for variables or
            commands, reading up to the next list whitespace, and then
            backslash substitution is done on the result.
        *   For both quoted and bare words, the rule seems to be that
            escapes are preserved without processing (so backslash-space)
            does not break a word; then backslash-substitution is done
            on the word after.
    *   Formatting vectors as lists:
        *   This is simply joining the words with whitespaceâ€”except that
            the words may need to be quoted.
        *   Details:
            *   TODO
*   Conclusions:
    *   This is sufficiently different from command parsing as to require
        distinct code (though some lower-level routines can be shared,
        e.g., the Context struct).  It doesn't make sense to confuse the
        command parsing routines with a bunch of if-tests.
    *   This is NOT `info complete` checking, which does need to be
        part of the command parser.
*   Added Interp::complete() and "info complete".
    *   As part of doing "info complete" I added a subcommand mechanism
        and stubs for "info commands" and "info vars".
*   Added list parsing and formatting: `crate::list::get_list()` and
    `crate::list::list_to_string()`.

### 2019-01-19 (Saturday)
*   Added `set` command
    *   Because it makes it easier to test the parser.
*   Spent some time on documentation and tests.
    *   Moved the basic utility functions to lib.rs, since the user will
        want to use them as, e.g., `molt::check_args()`.
*   Added command interpolation.
*   Added variable interpolation.
*   Added backslash substitution.
*   Changed name to "molt".
*   Added "test" command, kind of a baby TclTest command.
*   Began adding tests for the current command set.
    *   test/test_commands.tcl
    *   Found a parsing bug
    *   Added test/test_parser.tcl to verify the bug and the fix.
    *   Fixed it.
    *   Completed the tests for `exit`, `puts`, `set`
        *   Couldn't really test `puts`, as I don't capture stdout.
*   Ultimately I'm going to want a fancier test harness.  I'm thinking of
    a set of subcommands:
    *   molt shell
    *   molt run
    *   molt test


### 2019-01-18 (Friday)
*   Extended `Interp::eval` with the basic parser skeleton.
    *   Handles comments
    *   Handles quoted and braced strings.
    *   Does not yet handle backslash escapes, or command and variable
        interpolation.

### 2019-01-16 (Wednesday)
*   Added `Context` struct as a parsing aid.

### 2019-01-14 (Monday)
*   Result handling:
    *   `Result<>` and the `?` syntax is the way Rust provides non-local
        returns back through the call stack.
    *   That's the behavior we want for all of the result codes except
        TCL_OK.
    *   Thus, TCL_OK really is `Ok(_)`, while TCL_RETURN, TCL_BREAK, TCL_CANCEL,
        and TCL_ERROR are all flavors of `Err(_)`.
    *   The T in `Ok(T)` can reasonably change from one function to another,
        i.e., in `molt::get_int()` T can be `i32`, which in `molt::eval()` it
        can be a String.  But the E in `Err(E)` really needs to be the same,
        so that it can propagate.
    *   So what I want is `type InterpResult = Result<String,ResultCode>` where
        `ResultCode` is `enum {Error(String), Return(String), Break, Continue}`.
    *   I can mitigate the nuisance of using these codes in client code by
        defining some helper functions, e.g., `fn error(String) -> InterpResult`.

### 2019-01-13 (Sunday)
*   Beginning to try to replicate the Tcl 7.6 Tcl_Eval in Rust.
    *   Was able to follow Tcl_Eval for the most part.
        *   Although it uses some gotos.
    *   But Tcl_Eval calls TclParseWords, which implements a finite
        state machine using gotos in a way that simply isn't easily
        translatable into Rust.  Humph.
    *   And, of course, there's lots of low-level memory management
        foofaraw that doesn't apply to what I'm doing.
    *   And Ousterhout et al were a little casual about their
        indentation.
    *   I might actually be better off trying to implement the
        Octalogue directly (https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Dodekalogue).
*   What have I learned?
    *   Tcl 7.6 isn't a great example (though it will help)
        *   Still highly optimized.
        *   Logic is obscured by C memory handling
            *   Rust vectors and iterators should help a lot.
    *   Requirements:
        *   Ability to parse without evaluating (e.g., "info complete")
        *   Need to track stack depth, and cut it short before the Rust
            app blows up.
            *   Therefore, using "?" syntax isn't desirable in
                molt::eval, as I can't decrement the stack depth.
    *   Result and result code handling
        *   Tcl's interp result and return code scheme isn't a great match
            for Rust's `Result<>` type.  What you want to do is add
            Break, Continue, and Return(val).
        *   It's probably easier to add a "result" String to interp, to be
            set for error messages and other result values, and add
            a ResultCode enum for use with Ok.
        *   Begin as you mean to go on: the "result" object probably should
            wrap a string rather than be a string, so I can implement
            something like Tcl_Obj in the long run.
*   Tried this; don't like it.
    *   Using `Result<>` is handy for check_args, etc., but otherwise
        a nuisance.
        *   Better to use a custom return enum, and write a macro
            like try!().
        *   Did that. (Except for try!)
*   Parsing context
    *   Simple struct.  Contains a peekable iterator, and parsing
        flags.  eval() creates it, passes it to eval_script() (new), which
        parses and evaluates commands.
        *   Flags: parse only, looking for square bracket or not,
            maybe stack depth.

## 2019-01-09 (Wednesday)
*   Extended the Interp::eval() method to actually parse a script, execute
    each command, and return the result of the last command.
    *   It throws the proper error if a command isn't remembered.
*   The shell now calls Interp::eval() when it ought to.
*   Next steps:
    *   Add set and unset methods, and variable storage.
    *   Reorganize the code.
    *   Add string quoting and interpolation to the parser.
    *   Add list processing.
*   Basic principle for now: naive is fine.  Make it naive, and write
    a test suite.  Then I can make it smarter.

## 2019-01-08 (Tuesday)
*   Revised to use command storage and traits as described in yesterday's
    journal entry.
*   Added a rustyline-based shell, but it doesn't actually call the interpreter
    yet.

## 2019-01-07 (Monday)

*   Insight: Command Storage
    *   The commands map is a map from String to Rc<CommandEnum>
    *   A command can be a built-in command function, or a proc.
        CommandEnum can handle both cases.
    *   Commands are *always* looked up by name at run time.
        *   Because the name can be changed, and procs can be
            redefined.
    *   Basic Principle: Tcl is evaluated *as though* the scripts and
        proc bodies were saved as Strings, not byte-compiled.
    *   When evaluating a proc body, the interpreter clones the
        Rc<CommandEnum>.  The reference count will be decremented at
        the end of the call.
    *   If the proc renames itself, the lookup table is changed, but
        the definition is not, and since it's an Rc that's OK.
    *   If the proc redefines itself, the Rc in the hashmap is replaced
        by a new one; and when the proc stops executing, the old version
        is cleaned up.
    *   Woohoo!
*   Insight: Command Context
    *   A command can be passed a context struct using RefCell.  It can
        borrow it and update it as needed, so long as it itself is
        executing.
    *   Still to be answered: how to allow different commands to be
        passed different context cells?
        *   Probably need to use trait objects.
        *   A proc is already a struct.
        *   A built-in command could also be implemented as a struct.
*   Simplest approach for now:
    *   Parse and evaluate in one go.
        *   Simplifies the parser.
        *   Pretty much guarantees I get the right semantics.
    *   Write detailed tests.
    *   Then elaborate as needed.

## 2019-01-06 (Sunday)

*   Still pondering how to add context to client-defined commands.
    *   So that the command can make direct changes to the user's data.
*   At present, Interp is defined as Interp<T>, and a mutable T is passed
    to each command when it executes.  But it means that all commands
    get the same T.  This might be fine for a game, where there's a single
    context, but it's not general.
*   It might be possible to give each command its own context struct, which
    is *owned* by the Interp and can be modified by the command; and then
    queried by the owner of the Interp.

## 2019-01-05 (Saturday)

*   Created the project.
*   The first step is to parse a script into commands, and parse the commands
    into words, according to the Dodekalogue.
*   I will need an Interp to handle this.
*   Added an Interp struct with new(), define(), eval() methods, although eval()
    doesn't do anythingy yet.
*   Added molt_check_args() function.  Perhaps should be method.
    *   Not clear whether I want the Interp API to be methods or functions.
*   Realized that I needed a Context type, so that client-created extensions
    can access their context.  But I'm not at all sure how to do this
    generally; it's much trickier than in C.
