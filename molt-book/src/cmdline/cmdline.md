# Command Line Tool

Molt is primarily intended to be a crate for use in Rust applications; however,
it also provides a command line tool for use in development and experimentation.
The command line tool, called `molt`, has two subcommands:

[**molt shell**](./molt_shell.md) executes scripts and provides an
interactive REPL.

[**molt test**](./molt_test.md) executes Molt test suites, most notably
Molt's own test suite.
